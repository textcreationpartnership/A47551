            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> Law; It reſts (ſaith he) to prove the affirmitive part by the Principles of Chiſts Law thus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very natural body hath power given of God to reſiſt againſt the contrary, and to preſerve it ſelf in due eſtate; inaſmuch as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without life are indued with ſuch a kind of power, as hardneſs to reſiſt thoſe things that would break it, and coldneſs to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand heat that would diſſolve it, foraſmuch then as the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> after the manner of phraſe of Scripture ought to be one Body, of which the King is head, and the Commonalty are the members thereof. It ſeemeth the ſame Kingdom head and members, hath ſuch power given to them of God, and ſo much the more apparent, by how much the ſame body is more precious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, adorned with virtue and knowledge; for ſo much then, as there is no power given of God unto any Creature for any end or purpoſe, but that he may lawfully uſe the ſame to that end and purpoſe. It followeth, That our Kingdom may lawfully keep back and detain their Treaſure of Temporalities and Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the defence of it ſelf in what caſe ſoever neceſſity doth require the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſame is proved by the Law of the Goſpel, for the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot challenge the Treaſure of this Kingdom (no more can the Prelates challenge Temporalities or Tythes) but under the title of Almes, and conſequently under the pretence of works of mercy, according to the rule of Charity. But in the caſe aforeſaid the title of Alms ought utterly to ceaſe; <hi>ergo,</hi> the right title of challenging the Treaſure of this Kingdom ought to ceaſe alſo in the preſuppoſed neceſſity, and the Prelates and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie challenging Temporalities and Tythes ought to ceaſe alſo by the ſame reaſon: Foraſmuch as all Charity, hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it ſelf; it were no work of Charity, but of meer madneſs, to ſend away the Treaſure of the Realm unto other Nations,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34956:12"/>
whereby the Realm it ſelf may fall into ruine, under the pretence of ſuch a Charity: and is it not as much madneſs to ſuffer ſo many idle Drones to uſurp the Kingdomes, the Churches, and the Poors goods, of temporalities and tythes, to ſpend on Coaches, and Horſes, Hawks, Dogs, and Hounds? (I will not ſay Whores, Taverns, Cards and Dice;) Why ſhould not ſuch unfaithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards give an account of their Stewardſhip?</p>
               <p>It appears alſo (ſaith he) by this, That Chriſt, the Head of the Church. whom all Prelates and Prieſts ought to follow, he lived by the Alms of devout women, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.2, 3. he hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, and thirſted, was a ſtranger, and ſuſtained many other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, not only in his members, but alſo in his own body; He was poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. Wherefore, in the firſt endowing of the Church with Alms, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he were of the Clergy that had any temporal poſſeſſions, he had the ſame by way of Almes; as ſeveral Writings and Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles do witneſs: For, (ſaith he) the Temporal Lords have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take away their Alms, when they ſee their Alms abuſed to riot and exceſs by ſome, and others, who are intereſted therein, ſuffer penury and want, by the Prelates and Clergy their unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in their Stewardſhips.</p>

And beſides, he ordered the goods given to the Church. to be diſpoſed of ſo, That in wealthy places, two parts of the Church goods ſhould be given to the poor, and the third part to the Clergy: and that in poorer places, there ſhould be an equal diviſion between the poor and the Clergy. The good Lord, if it be his good will and pleaſure, put it into the hearts of all Chriſtian Kings and Princes to do the like.</p>

Theſe examples do inform us, what manner of perſons Biſhops were in thoſe dayes, the firſt 600 years after Chriſt, in poverty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility imitating Chriſt and his Apoſtles: but Biſhops in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes do rather imitate <hi>Lucifer</hi> for Pride, <hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>Gehazi</hi> for Covetouſneſs, and <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved the wages of iniquity, more like than followers of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in Patience, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and Humility: By their fruits you may know them, ſaith our Saviour.</p>

               <p>It is incredible that Chriſt ſhould appoint ſuch an high Officer in the Church; as the Lord Biſhop or Diocoſan Biſhop, or Lord <hi>Primate</hi> or Lord <hi>Metropolitan</hi> to bear ſuch an high handover the Church and people of God, and yet never give them any name in all the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby they ſhould be known and diſtinguiſhed from other Church Officers which Chriſt at his Aſſention gave <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the miniſtry, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt. Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. Hence it is clear that they are no Goſpel Creatures, nor their Authority and Juriſdictions were never inſtituted by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. <hi>that he kept back nothing that was profitable for the Church, but taught them both publickly and from houſe to houſe, and ſhunned not to declare unto them all the Counſel of God. verſe.</hi> 27. And yet <hi>Paul</hi> hath not in all his Epiſtles named one of theſe Officers nor their offices.</p>
               <p>God himſelf in the time of the Law preſcribed all the Circumſtances and Ceremonies, Officers and Offices that was to be uſed in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice and left not any thing to the will and deviſing neither of <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Aaron</hi> nor any other, &amp; God hath given Chriſt to be head to the Church <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>he is the head of all Principallity and power. Col.</hi> 2.10. So that Chriſt is Soveraign and Supream, the Sole and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lawgiver to the Church which is his Miſtical body, to give Laws unto his Church both for the outward polity and inward purity of the ſame, in the duties of his worſhip and ſervice; And I think it doth argue a very unworthy, If not blaſphemous carriage towards Chriſt, for any man or men Inconſiderately to intrude upon Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to alter or change, to add or diminiſh from Chriſt the Lawgivers inſtitutions, either for matter or manner, for Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Ceremonies, Officers or Offices other than Chriſt gave at his Aſſention <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints. Eph.</hi> 4 11, 12, 13.

               <p>Then is not this ſufficient to convince any reaſonable man, that to alter and change the worſhip of God from the rules and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt to the rules and Cannons of mens deviſing, and to force men ſo to worſhip, doth make a greater difference in the worſhip of God, than in the time of the Law to offer the ſame ſacrifice in any other place but where God had appointed it to be ſacrificed, and yet the very alteration and change of the place made the ſame thing ſacrificed to be eſteemed the ſacrificing unto Devils, and not to God, have we not need then to take care that we keep cloſe to the rules and inſtitutions of Chriſt?

               <p>Again, if there be ſuch a God, who will be worſhipped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the traditions and devices of men and hath promiſed his preſence to hear and anſwer us in ſuch a way of worſhip, then he hath either revealed himſelf, that he will hear us and accept us in ſuch a way or he hath not revealed himſelf, let the Biſhops and Prelates ſhew us the Scripture, where God hath promiſed his preſence to hear and accept us in a way of worſhip of mans deviſing, and let the Commandement be ſhewed that bindeth us to worſhip ſo, but if the Biſhops and Prelates cannot ſhew us any ſuch Commandement that bindeth us ſo to worſhip, nor ſhew, us any promiſe of Gods preſence to hear and accept of us in ſuch a way, then ought not the Prelates to force us to ſuch a kind of worſhip, neither ought we to obey them, nor have we any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ground our faith upon, <hi>and whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Radulph</hi> calls it Idolatry in manners to prefer the creature before the Creator, and ſo in Prelates to prefer their Canons and Inventions before the Canons of Scripture, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We all know that under the Law God required that Sacrifice Oblations and Incenſe ſhould be offered unto him, but when they did not obſerve Gods way and order which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed, how they ſhould be offered, but deviſed a way of their own, you ſhall hear what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith of ſuch a deviſed worſhip, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an Oxe, is as if he flew a man, he that ſacrificeth a Lamb is as if he cut off a Dogs neck, he that offereth an Oblation as if he offered Swines blood, and he that burneth Incenſe as if he bleſſed an Idol,</hi> God eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no better of mens deviſed way of worſhip, as appears in the latter part of the verſe. <hi>(viz.)

               </p>
               <p>But perhaps ſome men may think, that men may preſcribe rules for the outward form and duties of Gods worſhip by the example of <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> who ordered the courſes of the Prieſts and Levites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How they ſhould ſerve in the temple when <hi>Solomon</hi> had built it, and gave the pattern thereof unto <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> But with ſubmiſſion to better judgements, I think <hi>David</hi> did not that as he was a King only, but as he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and received the pattern thereof form God by his ſpirit, for ſo he ſaith, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.12. <hi>He gave to Solomon the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, and in verſe</hi> 19. <hi>All this, ſaid David, the Lord made me underſtand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men think it a matter of nothing to frame a form of worſhip of their own deviſing, and think that God will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and well pleaſed therewith, whereas God will accept of no worſhip neither for matter nor manner but what he hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as you may ſee in <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> they thought it no great matter to take common fire, inſtead of fire from the alter to offer incenſe with unto the Lord, and yet for this very thing in not obſerving Gods appointment, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their burning of incenſe, <hi>there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them that they dyed, verſe</hi> 2. <hi>For God will be ſanctified,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, in them that come nigh unto him, ver.</hi> 3. This may teach all generations to the end of the world, how jealous God is in every part of his worſhip, that it be performed according to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions without alteration, or adding or diminiſhing after the deviſes of men, and ſhews us what need there is in reforming the Church, to make the word of God our Rule.</p>

ſwearing was vain and cuſtomary and not in ſuch a way as God had appointed oaths to be taken, and therefore he reckon'd it a falſe oath though the thing they ſwore was true: The Lord doth live, and ſo men may deviſe a way to worſhip God, and ſnatch here and there a ſentence or two of Scripture and mangle it in pieces and then patch it together to make up a form to pleaſe themſelves and it may be ſome others, and though the words for the matter of them are words of truth, yet this alſo is ſinful as to ſwear by <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi> or as the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> to ſwear the Lord liveth, Becauſe Chriſt hath not any where inſtituted ſuch a way of worſhip to jumble a many texts fetcht here and there together to make a form of worſhip, though the words themſelves be good yet they were not ordained for ſuch an end, nor we have neither precept nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ſo to uſe them, but from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt the Pope ſuch example may be taken by them that pleaſe; Conjurers, Witches and Charmers uſe or rather abuſe good words, for they often times mutter over the Creed and our Lords Prayer and ſeveral texts of Scripture to work their feats, but God hath not truſted us with the Scriptures for ſuch ends eſpecially not that thoſe who can pleaſe themſelves with ſuch a form, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame upon all others by penalties of impriſonment or baniſhment or the like as hath been done to ſome.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is impoſſible that ever there can be any right reformation or that the Church can be reduced to its primitive purity and dignity ſo long as the Biſhops and Prelates bears ſuch a ſway both in the Church and Common wealth, until God put it into the hearts and minds of Kings, Princes, and Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to take away the temporalities and tyths from Biſhops, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and Clergie which they have ſo long uſurpingly and unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detained from the King and Nobles and not performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for which their predeceſſors gave them, and ſacraligiouſly kept to their own uſe what was given for the uſe of the Poor, and ſo reduce them firſt to live after the examples of Chriſt and his Apoſtles according to the rule of the new Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt which is the thing I am now to ſhew, and not after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Antechriſt as now they do and will do if they may be ſuffered.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34956:46"/>
               <p>It may rationally be imagined that the Prelates and Clergy will ſay, that if temporallities and tythes be taken from them how ſhall they then live.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that ſuch an objection will argue want of faith in the objector, for can they pretend that they can truſt God with the ſalvation of their Souls, and can they not truſt God with their bodies, for food and rayment in the way of Gods appointment, unleſs they carve out a portion for themſelves by diſhoneſt gain, we muſt not preſume to be wiſer then God, to think that we can preſcribe a better way for the maintenance of Goſpel Miniſters, than Chriſt hath preſcribed to his Apoſtles, and they practiced, indeed I confeſs that mans way to be maintained by Lands and Tythes is a fit way for Theeves and Robbers that comes not in an the door by Chriſt into the Sheep-fold, but comes in at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or ſome other way by Anti-chriſts invention to rob and ſteal, as I knew a pretended Miniſter that ſaid, he cared not if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil had the flock, ſo that he had the fleece, maintenance by Lands and Tythes are fit only for ſuch and none elſe, and Chriſts way of maintenance, which I ſhall ſhew anon, is moſt fit for Chriſts Miniſters, who come into the Sheep-fold at the door by Chriſt, for ſuch Miniſters will neither teach nor provoke the people to any manner of Ceremonial worſhip, which they have not learned from Chriſt, and which he and his Apoſtles hath not inſtituted, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they preſume to ſeek their maintenance in unwarrantable ways, contrary to the precepts and example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for if they do, they do thereby lay an imputation upon the wiſdom and holineſs of Chriſt, as if he had not in his word ſufficiently provided for his own worſhip, and for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance except men will preſume to be wiſer then God.</p>
               <p>If Miniſters would approve themſelves to be true Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Jeſus Chriſt, by following his example, and live as he lived, then here is an example for them to follow, firſt Chriſt was poor as to worldly things, for he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>the foxes have holes, and the birds of the Air have neſts, but the Son of Man, who is alſo the Son of God, hath not where to lay his head, Mat.</hi> 8.20. but thus it pleaſed him to be an example of poverty and humility to all Goſpel Miniſters to follow his ſteps, that we by his poverty might be made rich in faith and good works.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:34956:47"/>
               <p>Secondly, he ſuffered hunger, and went to the Fig-tree expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find fruit thereon but found none, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.12.13. and at another time after his Reſurrection he asked his Apoſtles, <hi>have ye here any meat, and they gave him a piece of a broyled fiſh, and of an honey comb, and he did eat, Luk.</hi> 24.42.43. Thirdly, he was wearyed with travelling on foot, he had not his Coach and 4 or 6 horſes as our Biſhops have, you may know them by their fruits, whether they belong to Chriſt or Anti-chriſt, Chriſt was alſo thirſty, and asked water of a woman to drink, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6.7. but our Prelates drinks the beſt Wines. Fourthly, Chriſt had his maintenance by the charitable bounty and benevolence of the people, amongſt whom was <hi>Mary Magdalen, and Joanna the Wife of Chuſa Herods Steward, and Suſanna and many others who miniſtred to him of their ſubſtance, Luke</hi> 8.3. And this is the way that Chriſt hath ordained ſhould have their maintenance, namely by the bountiful and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable devotion of the people unto whom they miniſter, <hi>Learn of me</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heare, and ye ſhall find reſt to your Souls, for the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant above his Lord, Mat.</hi> 10.24. If Chriſt were ſo poor, why ſhould Prelates and Prieſts be ſo rich, if Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſuffered hunger and thirſt as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf and the reſt of the Apoſtles, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. <hi>That they did both hunger and thirſt and were naked and buffeted, and had no certain dwelling place,</hi> why then ſhould Prelates and Prieſts be ſo full and ſo gorgeouſly apparrelled and have ſuch ſtately pallaces ſetled on them for their lives. If Chriſt and his Apoſtles were wearied with travelling on foot, as <hi>Paul</hi> faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>That he was often in wearineſs and painfulneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Why ſhould Prelates and Prieſts have their Coaches and great horſes, and if Chriſt and his Apoſtles had their maintenance by the charitable devotion of the people, why ſhould Prelates and Prieſts have ſuch large revenues of temporallities and tythes, this is to make the Diſciple above his Maſter and the Servant above his Lord, contrary to the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24.</p>
               <p>For according to this example, when Chriſt ſent forth his twelve Apoſtles to preach, he commanded them, and in them all others that are right Goſpel Miniſters, ſaying, <hi>Provide neither
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34956:47"/>
Gold nor Silver nor Braſs in your Purſes, nor Scrip for your journey, neither two Coats &amp;c. for the workman is worthy of his meat, Mat.</hi> 10.9.10. and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Eat and drink ſuch things as they give,</hi> but Chriſt did not bid them, if the people did not give, that they ſhould take it by force of Law, as the practice of Prelates and Prieſts is, whereby they, like the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> make the offering to be abhorred, this is not Chriſts but Anti-chriſts way for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of miniſters, Chriſt only bids the Apoſtles, <hi>that thoſe who would not receive them, to ſhake off the duſt of their feet for a teſtimony againſt them,</hi> but yet with this threatning, <hi>that it ſhall be more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgement, than for thoſe people that receive not Gods meſſengers, nor allows them not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance out of their ſubſtance.</hi> Thus you ſee men are bound under pain of damnation, to give Chriſts Miniſters ſufficient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for God hath ordained that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the Corn, for ſaith Paul, if we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9.11.14. And yet this muſt not be exacted by Law or conſtraint, but as a matter of bounty, that every man as he purpoſeth in his heart, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let him give, not grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or of neceſſity for God loveth a chearful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.7. but this I ſay, <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly, and he which ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> God will proſper his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo much the more.</p>
               <p>If Churches might have leave from the ſupream magiſtrates according to the word of God to elect and chuſe their own mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, then as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any provide not for their own, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the faith and is worſe then an Infidel,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. for their choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him to be their paſtor, makes him to be related to them as one of their houſe, and as he layes out his time and ſtrength and tallent for the good of the Church, ſo the Church ſhould joyntly make proviſion for him and his family for the things of this life, <hi>that as he ſowes unto them ſpiritual things ſo he ought to reap their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things,</hi> and this is not a matter of liberty or courteſie which may be done or left undone, but it is a duty, a work of juſtice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Church is called and bound in conſcience to perform,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34956:48"/>
ſo that proviſion in this kind is wages and not benovolence, ſo when Chriſt ſent forth his Apoſtles, <hi>he bids them not to be ſolicitous for relief, for the workman is worthy of his wages, Luke</hi> 10.7.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. determines this by the verdict of all Laws, look at the law of nature, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe, &amp;c.</hi> Look at the Law of Nations who goeth a warfare a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his own charge, look at the Law of God, he hath ordained that thoſe who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel, this is the way to make good and laborious Miniſters, for no preaching, no wages and this wages ought to be ſo plentiful and comfortable, col ected by the people and given to the miniſter that he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his time, his ſtrength and ſtudy, <hi>and attend upon the work of the Lord without deſtraction,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. For if he ſhould be ſtraitned ſo as to be put to beſtow his time and thought on the week dayes to provide Bread for his family, how ſhall he be able to provide ſpiritual food for the Church upon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>And ſuch Miniſters as can live by faith in a holy dependance upon Chriſts promiſe, <hi>that in ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of Heaven and the righteouſneſs thereof, that all other things ſhall be added. Mat.</hi> 6.33. No doubt but God will both open the hearts and hands of the people to give bountifully unto ſuch Miniſters; And indeed, he that is a right Goſpel Miniſter called of God to his Office, his faith will bear him up againſt all difficulties and oppoſition whatſoever, with the Prophet <hi>Habbakkuk,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>although the Fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vine, the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the Fields ſhall yeild no meat, the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stalls, yet ſaith he I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation. Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the order how this maintenance may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the Miniſters, there is one text moſt pregnant and carries moſt concluſive evidence to direct and determine in this caſe, <hi>Gala.</hi> 6.6. <hi>let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good things,</hi> that is of all good things that is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable, and may Lawfully be communicated, A man may have one room to lodge in, one ſervant to attend him, one Coat to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, ſo much proviſion as will only ſupply his own neceſſity, and theſe cannot be made common.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:34956:48"/>
               <p>But whatſoever good things we may make common, if we have to ſerve our ſelves and to ſpare, every man ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate according to his place and portion, that God hath beſtowed upon him, whether Mony, Corn, Cattle, the Fruit of Orchards, Gardens, Wool, Flax, or Cloathing for him and his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be either for neceſſity, or comfort, that God caſts in occaſionally which may be communicated, they ſhould give ſome part thereof, towards the maintenance of their Miniſters, yet this is not to be levyed by compulſion, but every man is to give as God ſhall inlarge their hearts, and open their hands to ſo good a work, for he that Soweth liberally ſhall Reap liberally, and he that Soweth ſparingly ſhall Reap ſparingly, he that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſaith <hi>Paul let him do it with ſimplicity or liberally, and he that ſheweth mercy with chearfulneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. And our Saviour ſaith <hi>give and it ſhall be given unto you, good meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.38. And as he ſaid in another caſe, <hi>freely ye have received, freely give, for whatſoever we have it is the gift of God, charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. And if we uſe not well what he hath given us, he can when he will take it from us, unleſs he give it as a ſnare to try how men will uſe it.</p>
               <p>This I conceive to be the Goſpel rule for maintenance for Miniſters, that every one that is taught in the word, ought to communicate to him that teacheth according to their abillity this may be further inlarged upon if there be occaſion, but there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Goſpel duty which is too much neglected, and that is the miniſtring to the poor Saints, which was ſo frequently and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally uſed in the Apoſtles days, that <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. <hi>ſaid as touching the miniſtring to the Saints, it was ſuperfluous for him to write unto them, for he knew the forwardneſs of their minds to that duty,</hi> for he had in his former Epiſtle given them direction, how this duty ſhould be performed in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. <hi>Now concerning the Colection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches of Gallatia, even ſo do ye, upon the firſt day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him that their be no gathering when I come.</hi> The giving of alms is a duty well pleaſing to God, <hi>to do
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34956:49"/>
good and to diſtribute forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifice God is well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>there is that ſcattereth and yet increaſeth, and there is that with holdeth more then is meet, but it tendeth to poverty the liberall ſoul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth, ſhall be watered alſo himſelf, Prov.</hi> 11.24, 25. again he ſaith, <hi>caſt thy bread upon the waters thou ſhalt find it after many days,</hi> by waters is meant peoples and multitudes, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Give a potion to ſeven and alſo to eight for thou knoweſt not what evil ſhall be upon earth, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.1, 2. Some have thought that this Colection ought to be the tenth part of every mans profit, but whether it be ſo or not, this the Scriptures aſſure us off, <hi>that he which ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and he that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.6. as it is written, <hi>he hath diſperſed and given to the Poor, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs remaineth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 112.9.</p>
